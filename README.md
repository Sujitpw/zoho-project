# 🚚 Return Load Finder – Smart Logistics Bot  
### Built for **Zoho Hiring & Internship Challenge (2025)**  
### Powered by **Zoho Codeless Bot Builder + Web Integration**

---

## 📝 Introduction

This project is a **Logistics Automation Chatbot** built using **Zoho’s Codeless Bot Builder**.  
The bot addresses a real-world challenge commonly faced by truck drivers and shippers in India—  
**“Empty return trips → Time loss → Increased fuel expenses.”**

It helps automate and streamline logistics operations by enabling drivers to find return loads quickly and allowing shippers to post loads efficiently, reducing overall operational inefficiencies for both sides.

## 📌 Overview

Transport industry faces a major issue:

**After completing deliveries, drivers waste a lot of time searching for return loads.  
Sometimes they don’t find any load at all, forcing them to return with an empty truck —  
which increases fuel cost, reduces earnings, and decreases overall efficiency.**

Shippers also face problems like:
- No centralized system to post loads  
- No visibility of nearby drivers  
- Slow communication  

To solve these real-world logistics challenges, I created a **smart automated logistics bot**.
